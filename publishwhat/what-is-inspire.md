# An Overview of INSPIRE

The geographical information held by European countries does not currently join up - but the environment does. Environmental issues such as flooding, forest fires and climate change do not respect national borders.

To manage the environment better at European, national and local levels change is needed in how geographical information is managed and made available. INSPIRE seeks to make those changes happen by establishing a pan-European Spatial Data Infrastructure to enable the sharing of environmental information.

INSPIRE will enable data users to access and reuse data from multiple providers by forcing organisations to share their data using standardised network services whilst applying common data structures. INSPIRE will allow data users to:

* discover what data exists and where it is published
* access network services to consume data
* integrate and process data from many sources

INSPIRE complements the government's transparency and open data policies. Contributing directly to improvements in the way that data are published, and making it easier for users across the public, private and third sector to find data, and reuse it.

# INSPIRE Deadlines

INSPIRE imposes challenging deadlines, by December 2013 any data in scope of INSPIRE should have been published in-line with certain technical standards. Between 2012 and 2020, data must be transformed to comply with a standard set of data models to make data interoperable across Europe.

## New and Extensively Restructured Data

INSPIRE demands that any new or extensively restructured data be made compliant sooner than existing data.  INSPIRE should be considered when specifying new data and this data should be published as soon as is practical.
