The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) leads in the UK on implementation of the European Union Directive establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE). 

This work is led by Defra's Data management & Policy team. The team provides standards, guidance, technology and assistance to organisations with a duty to publish data under INSPIRE. Until March 2014, the work being done through the INSPIRE Project formed out of the UK Location Programme which was responsible for implementing the UK Location Strategy.

We are managing all the detailed technical and policy guidance around INSPIRE in the UK, previously published by the UK Location Programme. The Location Guidance and Tools page provides a summary of the guidance.

We would ask that you review this information before you contact us as we are a small team. If you can’t find the information you need to resolve your issue please contact UK-INSPIRE-Help@defra.gsi.gov.uk.

###INSPIRE Complaints and Appeals###

Our Guidance on INSPIRE complaints and appeals provides information for public authorities who are providing INSPIRE data and services on data.gov.uk/data. Public authorities are required to put in place processes to handle complaints they receive about the performance of their functions under the INSPIRE Regulations 2009.

The information in this document can also be used by users wishing to complain about the performance of a public authority. It will help them understand what they can complain about and how to make a complaint.

The Information Commissioner has also produced guidance and advice on INSPIRE complaints which can be found here
